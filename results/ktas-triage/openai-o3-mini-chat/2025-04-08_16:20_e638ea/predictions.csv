5.0,"This patient is stable with normal vital signs (aside from a known hypertensive reading) and only minimal ocular pain (2/10) despite the history of trauma. He is alert and there are no red‐flag signs such as severe pain, vision changes, or evidence of a globe-threatening injury. A suspected corneal abrasion in this context is generally considered a minor complaint that while needing evaluation, is not life‑ or sight‑threatening in an immediate sense.

Therefore, based on the KTAS guidelines, this presentation is categorized as a KTAS Level 5 (non‑urgent/minor problem)."
