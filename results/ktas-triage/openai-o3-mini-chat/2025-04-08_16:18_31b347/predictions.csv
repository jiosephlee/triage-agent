5.0,"Based on the patient's presentation—a stable 71‐year‐old man with minimal pain (rated 2/10) and normal vital signs, whose main complaint is right ocular pain likely due to a corneal abrasion without signs of complications—the case does not appear to be time‐sensitive or life‐threatening. In the KTAS system, this scenario aligns with a non‐urgent case.

Therefore, the appropriate KTAS acuity level is Level 5."
