2.0,"Based on the clinical details provided, Patient 2 appears to be the most acute. Here’s the reasoning:

• Patient 2 (26‐year‐old woman with a chin laceration and suspected mandible fracture) is tachycardic with a heart rate of 114 bpm. In the setting of facial trauma—especially one involving the mandible—there is concern not only for blood loss/pain but also for potential airway compromise if swelling or malalignment develops.

• In contrast, the other patients have relatively stable vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) and non–life‐threatening complaints. For instance, although Patient 3 (43‐year‐old man with headache) has a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure, he is alert with low pain intensity.

Because trauma (especially involving the head/face) requires careful airway assessment and rapid intervention, Patient 2 should be seen first according to the KTAS principles of prioritizing patients with potential airway and life‐threatening issues.

Thus, Patient 2 is the most acutely ill and should be seen first."
