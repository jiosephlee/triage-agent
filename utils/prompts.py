KTAS 1: Immediate aggressive treatment needed for life-threatening conditions. Requires immediate medical examination.

KTAS 3: Conditions that could lead to serious problems potentially requiring emergency intervention. Causes significant discomfort or impacts daily functions. Physician evaluation needed within 30 minutes.

KTAS 4: Condition associated with age-related factors or possibility of pain/complications. Treatment and re-verification within 1-2 hours. Physician evaluation needed within 60 minutes.

Let's first understand the problem and solve the problem step by step.

** Step 1: Assess Immediate Risk for ESI Level 1 **

- Is the patient dying or at immediate risk of death?
- Does the patient require an immediate life-saving intervention?

** Step 2: Evaluate Key Clinical Signs for ESI Level 2 **

Assess High-Risk Situations: Identify patients with potentially life-threatening conditions who do not require immediate life-saving interventions but should not wait. Use the rule of thumb: “Would I use my last open bed for this patient?” Key indicators include:
- Severe chest pain, suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
- Respiratory distress (e.g., severe asthma, pleural effusion)
- Neurological deficits (e.g., stroke symptoms, meningitis suspicion)
- Uncontrolled bleeding or significant trauma

Evaluate Mental Status Changes: Classify patients with new onset confusion, lethargy, or disorientation as ESI Level 2. This includes:
- Suspected stroke (sudden motor/speech deficits)
- Altered mental status from metabolic, toxic, or neurological causes
- Pediatric patients with signs of sepsis or dehydration

Prioritize Severe Pain or Distress: Patients reporting severe pain (≥7/10) or severe psychological distress may qualify for Level 2 if their condition necessitates immediate intervention. Examples:
- Sickle cell crisis or acute oncologic pain
- Severe abdominal pain in elderly patients
- Trauma with high pain burden requiring urgent evaluation

** Step 3: Differentiate between ESI 3, 4 and 5 **
- Resource prediction is an integral part of the ESI for patients identified as ESI level 3 (many resources), 4 (one resource), or 5 (no resources).
- Resources include: Labs (blood, urine), ECG, X-rays, CT-MRI-ultrasound, angiography, IV fluids (hydration) , IV, IM or nebulized medications, Specialty consultation, Simple procedure (lac repair, Foley cath), Complex procedure (conscious sedation) 
- Check Danger Zone Vitals: If the patient has very high heart rate, breathing rate, or oxygen saturation below 92%, consider upgrading to ESI Level 2. Use these thresholds:
    - HR: >180 (infants), >160 (toddlers), >140 (children), >100 (older children/adults)
    - RR: >50 (infants), >40 (toddlers), >30 (children), >20 (older children/adults)
    - SaO₂: <92%

** Step 4: If it's not clear by now, determine the appropriate ESI acuity level to the best of your ability. **"""

ESI 1 indicates the highest priority (requiring immediate, life-saving intervention), and ESI 5 indicates the lowest priority (non-urgent, minimal resources needed). Here's a demonstration of how to do this:

Case: A 34-year-old obese female presents to triage complaining of generalized abdominal pain (pain scale rating: 6/10) for 2 days. She has vomited several times and states her last bowel movement was 3 days ago. She has a history of back surgery, takes no medications, and is allergic to peanuts. Vital signs: T 97.8° F, HR 104, RR 16, BP 132/80, SpO2 99 percent.
Rationale: This patient will need a minimum of two or more resources: lab, IV fluids, perhaps IV medication for nausea, and a CT scan. The triage nurse would review the patient's vital signs and consider the heart rate. The heart rate falls just outside the accepted parameter for the age of the patient but could be due to pain or exertion. In this case, the decision should be to assign the patient to ESI level 3."""
